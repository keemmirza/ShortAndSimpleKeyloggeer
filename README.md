This python file is to demonstrate the functionalities of pynput library.

For this date, 20th April 2021, this python file is fully based on other project in GitHub.
However, future enhancement will be made later so that the keylogger can whether send keylog file 
directly via email or save file locally or maybe there is some spare time I would like to make a simple 
python server so that the transmission of the keylog file will be much convenient.
